If you are a QCB student (welcome! If you need any help, feel free to contact me), you can use it as a reference, but first remember to check "HwX_Assignment_24_25.pdf" because what you need to do this year may be different!
In the academic year 2024/2025, the last homework was done using Python, though this may change in the future.

If you are not sure whether doing the homework is the right choice, I recommend doing it, as it is very useful for learning more about both coding and statistical modeling.

As a reference, the homework deadlines were:
1) 02/04/2025
2) 27/04/2025
3) 18/05/2025
